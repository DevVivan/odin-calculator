# Calculator

This was `Calculator`, the [*5th project*](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) within the Odin Project curriculum and the final one in Foundations. This was an assignment designed to consolidate students' knowledge and offer a finale to the Foundations course in an interesting manner.
